# sparta-cicd-app

## Introduction

This is a simple app that is used to demonstrate the CI/CD pipeline.

To set this up:

Install the Remote - SSH extension from the VS Code marketplace.
Use the Remote Explorer on the left side of VS Code or the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P on macOS) to start a new SSH connection.
Once connected, you can open your project and use the Source Control panel just like you do locally.
